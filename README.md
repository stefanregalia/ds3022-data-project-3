## Hypotheses to Test

### H1: Sentiment Analysis Hypothesis

**Null Hypothesis:** There is no difference in average sentiment scores between performance-related repository commit messages and simplicity-related repository commit messages.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** Performance-related repositories have lower sentiment scores than simplicity-related repositories.

**Reasoning:** Performance-related repositories may be more technical and challenging, potentially leading to more negative sentiment in commit messages, but we will test this with hypothesis testing.

### H2: Contributor Concentration Hypothesis

**Null Hypothesis:** There is no difference in contributor concentration (calculated by Gini coefficient) between performance-related and simplicity-related repositories.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** Performance-related repositories have a higher contributor concentration than simplicity-related repositories.

**Reasoning:** Performance-related repositories may require a small team of experts while simplicity-related repositories may have more diverse contributors as these packages can be used casually, but we will test this with hypothesis testing.

### H3: Weekend Activity Hypothesis

**Null Hypothesis:** There is no difference in the proportion of weekend activity between performance-related and simplicity-related repositories.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** Simplicity-related repositories have a higher proportion of weekend activity than performance-related repositories.

**Reasoning:** Users may contribute more to simplicity-related repositories on weekends than performance-related repositories, as much of this work can be lighter and less taxing.

### H4: Time Series Trend Hypothesis

**Null Hypothesis:** There is no difference in the ratio of commits to pull requests over time between performance-related and simplicity-related repositories.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** The ratio of pull requests to commits over time increases for performance-related and decreases for simplicity-related repositories.

**Reasoning:** The dynamics of contributions may vary over time between the two types of repositories, but we will test this with time series analysis and hypothesis testing.
